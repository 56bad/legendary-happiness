Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self.
I learned that we can do anything, but we can't do everything... at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything.

Time is everything
